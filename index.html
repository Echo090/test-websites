        <p>I'm Jerome Sagcal. Welcome to my web development journey day 01. Today, I learned the following:</p>
        <ul class="today-i-learned">
            <li>How to host my site in Github by doing Git-ish things I don't understand.</li>
            <li>Learned how to properly link a CSS stylesheet to an html file.</li>
            <li>Learned how to center this thing. Gosh this was more complicated than I thought.</li>
        </ul>
