        <h1>About this project</h1>
        <p>I'm Jerome Sagcal, and this is my coding quest. Everyday, I'll be learning one new thing about web development each day. I'll be building on top of this site each day, recoding and repolishing, so that eventually, I would end up with a decent-looking and functional site to showcase my portfolio. I'll be documenting my learning journey everyday. Hope you enjoy!</p>

            <h1>Day 01</h1>
            <p>Today, I learned the following:</p>
            <ul class="daily-summary">
                <li>How to host my site in Github by doing Git-ish things I don't understand.</li>
                <li>Learned how to properly link a CSS stylesheet to an html file.</li>
                <li>Learned how to center this thing. Gosh this was more complicated than I thought.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="entry">
            <h1>Day 02</h1>
            <p>I thought CSS was easy. Today, I learned:</p>
            <ul class="daily-summary">
                <li>Block, inline, and inline-block display. I'm going to forget about this. LOL</li>
                <li>Finally learned about flexbox, i think...</li>
                <li>Re-learned how to select an element under a given class selector. I keep on forgetting stuff I learned.</li>
                <li>Learned the differences between borders and outlines</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="entry">
            <h1>Day 03</h1>
            <p>Can't wait for tomorrow</p>
