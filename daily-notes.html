                    <p>I'm Jerome Sagcal, and this is my coding quest. Everyday, I'll be learning one new thing about web development. I'll be building on top of this site each day, recoding and repolishing, so that eventually, I would end up with a decent-looking and functional site to showcase my portfolio. I'll be documenting my learning journey everyday. Hope you enjoy!</p>

                        <h1>Day 01</h1>
                        <p>Today, I learned the following:</p>
                        <ul class="daily-notes-list">
                            <li>How to host my site in Github by doing Git-ish things I don't understand.</li>

                            <li>Learned how to center this thing. Gosh this was more complicated than I thought.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="daily-notes-entry">
                        <h1>Day 02</h1>
                        <p>I thought CSS was easy. Today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul class="daily-notes-list">
                            <li>Block, inline, and inline-block display. I'm going to forget about this. LOL</li>
                            <li>Finally learned about flexbox, i think...</li>
                            <li>Re-learned how to select an element under a given class selector. I keep on forgetting stuff I learned.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h1>Day 03</h1>
                        <p>It's day three and I haven't yet quit. Pat on my back, Jerome. Today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul class="daily-notes-list">
                            <li>Refreshed my lessons about inline-block display.</li>
                            <div class="mock-button">Button 1</div>
                            <div class="mock-button">Button 2</div>
                            <li>Learned how to make a fixed sidebar. Gosh the amount of things I needed to read and watch before I was able to find what I was looking for. Wow.</li>
                            <li>Learned a fix to finally solve my issue with flexbox yesterday!!!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="daily-notes-entry">
                        <h1>Day 04</h1>
                        <p>Didn't learn anything too much new today, I finally decided to do design the site. But today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul class="daily-notes-list">
                            <li>Learned to make a pinned or fixed image. This should have been a lot easier for me, but I was accidentally putting CSS code in my HTML. LOL</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="daily-notes-entry">
                        <h1>Day 05</h1>
                        <p>Contineud to refine the design of this site. I added another page too. I assume I'll be doing this over and over. Today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to import fonts from Google Fonts.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="daily-notes-entry">
                        <h1>Day 06</h1>
                        <p>Wah, I missed my lesson for yesterday. Nevertheless, let's push through. Today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Finally, CSS Grid. I've actually recoded this so this entries are in a grid instead of a flexbox.</li>
                            <li>Learned about media queries. This site should now look better with mobile phones.</li>
                            <li>Learned the difference between em and rem.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="daily-notes-entry">
                        <h1>Day 07</h1>
                        <p>I added another page to this site. It's going to contain my mock projects. I already added one, and it's a simple minimum effort tribute page to Stanley Kubrick. Today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learned more about grid features like grid-area.</li>
                            <li>Re-learned about CSS variable.Hopefully, I get to use it for my project tomorrow.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="daily-notes-entry">
                        <h1>Day 08</h1>
                        <p>I'm overthinking about this tribute page I'm making. Today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Other selectors such as the attribute selector and child selectors.</li>
                            <li>Learned that you could place more than one background in an element.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="daily-notes-entry">
                        <h1>Day 09</h1>
                        <p>Decided to keep things simpler. I don't have to rush myself anyway. As a lesson for today, I decided to code along with a video about responsiveness. Today, I learned:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Watching people code made me realize that there is no one way to code. It almost feels like art seeing someone code. There are techniques and best practices, but ultimately, it depends on the coder what he does to get his desired outcome.</li>
                            <li>Vendor prefixes. Also discovered useful sites such as caniuse.com and shouldiprefix.com.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
