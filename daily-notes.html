                    <h2>About this Project</h2>
                    <p>I'm Jerome Sagcal, and this is my coding quest. Everyday, I'll be learning one new thing about web development. I'll be building on top of this site each day, recoding and repolishing, so that eventually, I would end up with a decent-looking and functional site to showcase my portfolio. I'll be documenting my learning journey everyday. Hope you enjoy!</p>

                        <h1>Day 02</h1>
                        <p>I thought CSS was easy. Today, I learned:</p>

                            <li>Learned how to make a fixed sidebar. Gosh the amount of things I needed to read and watch before I was able to find what I was looking for. Wow.</li>

                            <li>Learned to make a pinned or fixed image. This should have been a lot easier for me, but I was accidentally putting CSS code in my HTML. LOL</li>
